    <h2>1. Magic Set</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Katya has a sequence of integers a1,a2,…,an and an integer m.

        She defines a good sequence of integers as a non-empty sequence such that the sum of the elements in each of its
        non-empty subsequences is divisible by m.

        Katya wants to know the number of good subsequences of the sequence a. Can you help her?

    <h2>2. A Puzzle Game </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Johnny has some difficulty memorizing the small prime numbers. So, his computer science teacher has asked him to
        play with the following puzzle game frequently.

        The puzzle is a 3x3 board consisting of numbers from 1 to 9. The objective of the puzzle is to swap the tiles
        until the following final state is reached:

        1 2 3
        4 5 6
        7 8 9
        At each step, Johnny may swap two adjacent tiles if their sum is a prime number. Two tiles are considered
        adjacent if they have a common edge.

        Help Johnny to find the shortest number of steps needed to reach the goal state.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <div>Input</div><br>
    The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 50). Then t test cases follow. Each test case consists of
    a 3x3 table describing a puzzle which Johnny would like to solve.

    The input data for successive test cases is separated by a blank line.

    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <div> Output</div><br>
    For each test case print a single line containing the shortest number of steps needed to solve the corresponding
    puzzle. If there is no way to reach the final state, print the number -1.

    <h2>3. Three Friends</h2>

    <p>
        There are three friends; let's call them A, B, C. They made the following statements:

        A: "I have x Rupees more than B."
        B: "I have y rupees more than C."
        C: "I have z rupees more than A."
        You do not know the exact values of x,y,z. Instead, you are given their absolute values, i.e. X=|x|, Y=|y| and
        Z=|z|. Note that x, y, z may be negative; "having −r rupees more" is the same as "having r rupees less".

        Find out if there is some way to assign amounts of money to A, B, C such that all of their statements are true.

        You are given the entries of the log, but you're not sure if it has been tampered with or not. Your task is to
